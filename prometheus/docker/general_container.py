  """A general-purpose container with a comprehensive development environment.

  This container provides a full Ubuntu-based development environment with common
  development tools and languages pre-installed, including Python, Node.js, Java,
  and various build tools. It's designed to be a flexible container that can
  handle various types of projects through direct command execution rather than
  predefined build and test methods.

  The container includes:
      - Build tools (gcc, g++, cmake, make)
      - Programming languages (Python 3, Node.js, Java)
      - Development tools (git, gdb)
      - Database clients (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
      - Text editors (vim, nano)
      - Docker CLI for container management
      - Various utility tools (curl, wget, zip, etc.)

  Unlike specialized containers, this container does not implement run_build() or
  run_test() methods. Instead, the agent will use execute_command() directly for
  custom build and test operations.
