"""Message state reset handler for workflow loops.

This module provides functionality to reset message states in workflow loops,
allowing the same state attribute to be reused across multiple iterations. It
supports clearing both list-type message collections and string-type message
states.

The module is specifically designed for workflows where:
- Message history needs to be cleared between loop iterations
- The same state attribute name is reused
